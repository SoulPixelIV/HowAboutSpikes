# HowAboutSpikes

## About
Small game that'll make us rich hopefully. /s

## Pussy Mode
Press nothing to enable the Pussy Mode since you won't need it since this is easy as pie if you playd it for a while. Actually most people have problems with the difficulty and at the moment it spiked heavily. It's fine though, it's fine.

## Known Bugs (biggest secton in the doc)
- Edge clipping (even worse now)
- ~~Hitbox clipping~~ (R.I.P. Wallclimb) crawl
- Something scythe something wallclimb (yet to find ^-^)
- Clip under spikes
- ~~Get stuck in the wall while attacking~~
- Attacking while dying = Flying through the map (maybe works now, couldn't reproduce recently)
- ~~Enemys peace out~~
- ~~Some checkpoints don't heal~~
- ~~Some checkpoints don't restore the breaking blocks~~
- Checkpoint font changes on entering a world
- ~~Teleport system spawns a second player~~
- Boss healthbar waves with the camera
- Enemys sometimes run away and their AI is pretty stupid in general
- Checkpoint font triggers even jumping over them

## License
None at the moment.

You're allowed to use the code if you mention the author, this is property of SoulPixelIV, please don't do anything weird with this.

Thanks.
